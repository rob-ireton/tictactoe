# Sedex Connect - Tic-Tac-Toe Front End Engineer Tech Test

## The task

We have a partial implementation of a tic-tac-toe game. You'll pair with Sedex engineers to complete this.

## How to approach the task

You **don't** have to complete the whole exercise, just make steady progress.

Focus on quality over speed. We're looking for your problem-solving approach and front-end development skills.

Treat this like a real-life pairing - feel free to ask questions, bounce ideas, look up stuff on the Internet etc.

## What we're looking for

1.  Effective communication in a pairing session
2.  Making small changes in a safe manner
3.  Overall front-end development skills
4.  Testing
5.  Code architecture
6.  Refactoring and cleanup

## Functional requirements

- Create a functioning Tic Tac Toe game where players alternate placing X's and O's on the board.
- Implement win detection for diagonal, horizontal, and vertical rows.
- Display a winning message if a player wins; otherwise, keep the game ongoing.
- Include a reset function to clear the board.

## Currently missing Features

Implement the following missing functionalities:

1. getWinner Function: Determine the game winner according to Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

2. squareClicked Function: Handle logic when a player clicks a square, updating the game state.

3. resetGame Function: Reset the game state for a new game.

## Fixing bugs or code smells

If you encounter any bugs, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement -- fix them as you go along.
